## ðŸ¤” ðŸ’­ What's up with this project?

## Technically

A lot.

I'm interweaving some things together that I'm learning.

- Developing in a **Linux** Environment
  - // I recently configured my system to dual-boot (Debian Based Linux Distro || Windows)
  - // I use a **Vim** integration extension within VS Code
- Learning and Integrating **TypeScript**
- Utilizing **Styled-Components**
- Using Functional Components and **React Hooks**
- Accessability best practices, focusing on **Semantic HTML and Aria Support**

## Content

The content of this site should be pretty simple.
For now, I just want this to connect to the youTube API, grab some information from a specific playlist, and generate a card that will link to the youTube video.

More specifically, this app will display acroyoga videos that my acro-partner and I make.

Nothing extravagant, mainly just rough edits from our practice sessions so that we can track, reference, and share our progress.
